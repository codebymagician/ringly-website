    <h1>Ringly – Account Deletion FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 1st December 2026</p>

    <h2>1. How do I start the account deletion process?</h2>
    <p>To request deletion of your Ringly account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the Ringly app and go to Settings</li>
        <li>Select Delete Account</li>
        <li>Log in and verify your identity</li>
        <li>Enter your mobile number and email address (this helps us share any downloadable data linked to your account)</li>
        <li>Share your reason for deleting the account (optional)</li>
        <li>Tap Submit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What happens after I submit a deletion request?</h2>
    <p>Once the deletion process is initiated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will immediately lose access to your account.</li>
        <li>Your profile and all associated account elements (including call recordings, if any) will no longer be visible to other users.</li>
        <li>You will be unable to post, share, upload, or interact with any content on the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It may take some time for the system to completely remove all your account data. In a few cases, certain content links you previously generated may remain visible for a short period, but your profile will not be accessible through them.</p>
    <p>Please note that Ringly may retain certain personal information for a limited period to comply with regulatory, legal, and security obligations. We may also preserve anonymized or aggregated data.</p>

    <h2>3. Can I cancel my deletion request?</h2>
    <p>Yes. You may log back into the Ringly app within 30 days of submitting your deletion request and cancel it. If you don’t cancel within this window, your account will be permanently deleted and cannot be restored.</p>

    <h2>4. How can I download my data?</h2>
    <p>If you opted to receive your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will send a download link to the email address you provided during the deletion request.</li>
        <li>The link remains active for 7 days.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions in the email to download your information.</li>
        <li>Your data package may include posts, comments, messages, profile details, and other information you provided during your time on Ringly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please ensure your email address is correct. It may take some time for us to process and generate your data download.</p>

    <h2>5. What happens to my Coins after I delete my account?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We encourage you to use any remaining Coins before initiating the deletion process.</li>
        <li>Ringly does not offer refunds for unused Coins. For more details, please review our Coins Policy.</li>
    </ul>
