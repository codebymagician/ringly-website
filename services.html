    <h1>Our Services</h1>

    <h2>Make New Friends via Audio & Video Calls</h2>
    <p>
        Ringly is a premier 1:1 conversational platform designed to foster real friendships in a secure digital environment.
        We believe that personality matters more than looks, which is why we use AI Avatars to keep your identity private while you connect.
    </p>

    <h3>What Makes Ringly Different</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity-Safe:</strong> Connect via voice & anonymous avatars without the pressure of photos or video.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Moderated:</strong> All calls are monitored by advanced AI models to ensure a safe, respectful, and moderated experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct & Personal:</strong> Focused entirely on meaningful 1:1 engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transparent Pricing Structure</h2>
    <p>
        We offer a flexible, usage-based pricing model designed to grow with your journey on the platform.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Conversations (1:1 Calls)</h3>
    <p>
        Access to 1:1 audio rooms is billed on a per-minute basis. Our variable pricing ensures accessibility for new users
        while rewarding high-engagement interactions as you progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Rate:</strong> Starting as low as ₹1 per minute and going up to ₹20 per minute, depending on the specific room type,
        user level, or community tier.
    </p>

    <h2>Billing & Payments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Instant Access:</strong> All services are enabled immediately upon successful payment of credits/coins.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> All payments are processed through our secure partner ensuring industry-standard encryption and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All prices listed are in Indian Rupees (INR).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines the terms and conditions for payments made on the Ringly mobile application,
        operated by Voxstream Technologies Private Limited.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Nature of Services</h3>
    <p>
        Ringly provides digital services, including real-time 1:1 audio conversations. Since these services are consumed instantly
        (per-minute billing) or involve the transfer of digital goods, they are generally non-refundable once utilized.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Virtual Credits / Coins</h3>
    <p>
        Users purchase digital credits/coins to access premium audio features.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Once coins have been used to initiate a call, the transaction is considered final and cannot be reversed.</li>
        <li><strong>Unused Balances:</strong> If you have an unused credit balance and wish to seek a refund due to a technical error, please contact our support team within 48 hours of the transaction.</li>
        <li>Refunds will not be issued for minutes already consumed during a conversation.</li>
        <li>
            In the event of a documented technical failure (e.g., a call drop due to a platform server error where the user was billed
            for minutes not provided), Ringly will credit the affected minutes back to the user’s in-app wallet upon verification.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Technical Malfunctions</h3>
    <p>
        If a payment is successful but the credits fail to reflect in your account due to a technical glitch:
    </p>
    <p>
        Please email us at <strong>support@ringly.in</strong> with your Transaction ID and Registered Mobile Number.
        We will investigate and either credit the amount to your wallet or initiate a refund to the original payment source within 5-7 working days.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Users can stop using the service at any time by ending the audio call or closing the application.
        There are no long-term subscription commitments or cancellation fees.
        Once a call is ended, no further per-minute charges will be accrued.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Abuse of Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Voxstream Technologies Private Limited reserves the right to refuse refund requests if there is evidence of fraud,
        platform abuse, or violation of our Terms of Service.
    </p>
